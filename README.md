infinite-list.js
================

infinite-list.js is a jQuery plugin that makes long scrolling lists more efficient. It works by taking items in and out of the dom as they are scrolled in and out of view, similar to the technique used in the iOS UITableView. 

Coming soon

Currently we just have the barebones plugin out here, and in the near future will be adding the following:

* Add unit tests
* Add demo/test app
